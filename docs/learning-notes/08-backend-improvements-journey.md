## Initial Implementation

### What We Built

**Feature:** Database Persistence with JPA/Hibernate

**Technologies:**
- H2 file-based database
- Hibernate 6.2.7 (JPA implementation)
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- RESTful API with JAX-RS

**Architecture:**
```
HTTP Request → MovieResource (REST) → MovieService (Business Logic)
              → MovieRepository (Data Access) → EntityManager → H2 Database
```

**Key Files Created:**
- `persistence.xml` - JPA configuration
- `MovieRepository.java` - Data access layer
- Updated `MovieService.java` - Business logic with validation
- Updated `App.java` - EntityManagerFactory lifecycle management

---

## Critical Bug Fixes (Issue #4)

After the initial merge, a comprehensive code review identified **5 critical issues**. Here's how we fixed each one:

### Fix 1: EntityManager Resource Leak

**Problem:**
```java
public boolean delete(Long id) {
    EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
    try {
        em.getTransaction().begin();
        Movie movie = em.find(Movie.class, id);

        if (movie != null) {
            em.remove(movie);
            em.getTransaction().commit();
            return true;
        }

        // CONFUSING CONTROL FLOW!
        // Rollback and return mixed together makes code hard to maintain
        em.getTransaction().rollback();
        return false;
    } finally {
        em.close();  // Actually executes (Java guarantees this)
    }
}
```

**Why This Is Bad:**
- **NOT a resource leak** - finally blocks ALWAYS execute in Java (guaranteed by specification)
- **Real problem is maintainability**: Early returns mixed with transaction management create confusing control flow
- Hard to trace execution paths
- Makes code review difficult
- Violates single exit point principle
- Can confuse developers who might think finally won't execute

**Solution:**
```java
public boolean delete(Long id) {
    EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
    try {
        em.getTransaction().begin();
        Movie movie = em.find(Movie.class, id);

        if (movie == null) {
            // Rollback BEFORE return - keeps control flow clear
            em.getTransaction().rollback();
            return false;
        }

        em.remove(movie);
        em.getTransaction().commit();
        return true;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        if (em.getTransaction().isActive()) {
            em.getTransaction().rollback();
        }
        throw e;
    } finally {
        // ALWAYS executes, regardless of return path
        em.close();
    }
}
```

**Educational Value:**
- **Finally blocks ALWAYS execute in Java** - This is guaranteed by the Java Language Specification, regardless of return statements, exceptions, or break/continue
- The real issue here is code clarity and maintainability, not resource leaks
- Separating rollback from return makes control flow explicit and easier to understand
- Good code should be obvious - mixing transaction management with early returns creates cognitive load
- Single exit point pattern: One return statement makes code easier to trace and debug

---

### Fix 2: Thread Safety Race Condition

**Problem:**
```java
public class MovieResource {
    // Field initialized during class instantiation
    private final MovieService movieService = App.getMovieService();

    // RACE CONDITION!
    // JAX-RS may instantiate MovieResource BEFORE App.main()
    // finishes initializing MovieService
    // Result: NullPointerException
}
```

**Why This Is Bad:**
- JAX-RS scans and instantiates resources during startup
- App.main() initializes EntityManagerFactory in parallel
- Race condition: which finishes first?
- If MovieResource instantiates first → NPE
- Non-deterministic failure (works sometimes, fails others)

**Solution:**
```java
public class MovieResource {
    // Don't initialize during field declaration
    private MovieService movieService;

    // Lazy initialization - only when actually needed
    private MovieService getService() {
        if (movieService == null) {
            movieService = App.getMovieService();
            if (movieService == null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(
                    "Application not fully initialized"
                );
            }
        }
        return movieService;
    }

    @GET
    public Response getAllMovies() {
        // Use getter, not field directly
        List<Movie> movies = getService().getAllMovies();
        return Response.ok(movies).build();
    }
}
```

**Educational Value:**
- Initialization order matters in concurrent systems
- Field initialization happens at object creation time
- Lazy initialization defers until first use
- Always consider "when does this code execute?"
- Non-deterministic bugs are the hardest to debug

---

### Fix 3: TOCTOU Race Condition in Update

**Problem:**
```java
public Movie updateMovie(Movie movie) {
    // Check existence
    if (repository.findById(movie.getId()) == null) {
        return null;  // Not found
    }

    // TIME GAP HERE!
    // Another thread could delete the movie between check and update

    // Update
    return repository.update(movie);
}
```

**Why This Is Bad:**
- Time-Of-Check to Time-Of-Use vulnerability
- Thread A: checks existence → movie exists ✓
- Thread B: deletes the movie
- Thread A: tries to update → behavior undefined
- Classic concurrency bug

**Solution (Attempt 1 - Incomplete):**
```java
public Movie update(Movie movie) {
    // Check existence WITHIN transaction
    em.getTransaction().begin();
    Movie existing = em.find(Movie.class, movie.getId());
    if (existing == null) {
        em.getTransaction().rollback();
        return null;
    }

    // Still uses merge() - not ideal
    Movie updated = em.merge(movie);
    em.getTransaction().commit();
    return updated;
}
```

**Solution (Final - Best Practice):**
```java
public Movie update(Movie movie) {
    em.getTransaction().begin();

    // Find returns MANAGED entity
    Movie existing = em.find(Movie.class, movie.getId());
    if (existing == null) {
        em.getTransaction().rollback();
        return null;
    }

    // Update managed entity directly
    // JPA dirty checking auto-detects changes
    existing.setTitle(movie.getTitle());
    existing.setGenre(movie.getGenre());
    existing.setDurationMinutes(movie.getDurationMinutes());
    existing.setPrice(movie.getPrice());

    // Commit - JPA auto-generates UPDATE
    em.getTransaction().commit();
    return existing;
}
```

**Why Direct Update Is Better:**
- Check and update happen atomically in one transaction
- No merge() overhead (no object copying)
- Leverages JPA dirty checking (automatic change detection)
- Clearer intent - we're updating, not merging
- More efficient - JPA only updates changed fields

**Educational Value:**
- Atomicity: operations must be indivisible
- TOCTOU vulnerabilities are common in concurrent systems
- JPA entity states: transient, managed, detached, removed
- Dirty checking: JPA tracks managed entity changes
- Always think: "what if another thread runs between these lines?"

### Fix 4: Comprehensive Input Validation

**Problem:**
```java
public Movie createMovie(Movie movie) {
    // No validation!
    return repository.save(movie);
}

// Results in:
// - NullPointerException when movie is null
// - Empty titles saved to database
// - Negative prices accepted
// - Zero duration movies created
```

**Solution:**
```java
public Movie createMovie(Movie movie) {
    // 1. Null check
    Objects.requireNonNull(movie, "Movie cannot be null");

    // 2. Required fields
    if (movie.getTitle() == null || movie.getTitle().trim().isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Movie title cannot be empty");
    }

    if (movie.getGenre() == null || movie.getGenre().trim().isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Movie genre cannot be empty");
    }

    // 3. Business rules
    if (movie.getPrice() == null || movie.getPrice() <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
            "Movie price must be positive (got: " + movie.getPrice() + ")"
        );
    }

    if (movie.getDurationMinutes() == null || movie.getDurationMinutes() <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
            "Movie duration must be positive (got: " + movie.getDurationMinutes() + ")"
        );
    }

    // 4. Data normalization
    movie.setTitle(movie.getTitle().trim());
    movie.setGenre(movie.getGenre().trim());
    if (movie.getDescription() != null) {
        movie.setDescription(movie.getDescription().trim());
    }

    return repository.save(movie);
}
```

**Validation Layers:**
```
REST Layer (MovieResource)
    ↓ Receives HTTP request, deserializes JSON
Service Layer (MovieService) ← VALIDATE HERE
    ↓ Business logic and validation
Repository Layer (MovieRepository)
    ↓ Data access only
Database
```

**Why Validate in Service Layer:**
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Business logic belongs in service layer
- ✅ Repository stays focused on data access
- ✅ Easy to test validation in isolation
- ✅ Consistent validation regardless of caller

**Educational Value:**
- Fail-fast principle: catch errors early
- Clear error messages aid debugging
- Validation is business logic, not data access
- Normalization (trimming) improves data quality
- Include actual values in error messages (for debugging)

---

### Fix 5: Prevent JSON Infinite Recursion

**Problem:**
```java
@Entity
public class Movie {
    private Long id;
    private String title;

    // If we add this later:
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "movie")
    private List<Booking> bookings;
}

@Entity
public class Booking {
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Movie movie;  // Refers back to Movie
}
```

**Serialization Loop:**
```
Serialize Movie
  → Serialize bookings
    → Serialize Booking
      → Serialize movie
        → Serialize bookings
          → Serialize Booking
            → ... INFINITE LOOP! 💥
```

**Solution:**
```java
@Entity
public class Booking {
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "movie_id", nullable = false)
    @JsonBackReference  // Break the cycle!
    private Movie movie;
}

// In Movie (if we add bookings later):
@Entity
public class Movie {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "movie")
    @JsonManagedReference  // Forward reference
    private List<Booking> bookings;
}
```

**How It Works:**
- `@JsonManagedReference` - Forward side (serializes normally)
- `@JsonBackReference` - Back side (NOT serialized)
- Breaks the cycle by skipping "back" reference during serialization

**Educational Value:**
- Bidirectional relationships create cycles
- Jackson needs hints to break cycles
- @JsonBackReference/@JsonManagedReference work together
- Think about serialization when designing entity relationships
- Alternative solutions: DTOs, @JsonIgnore, custom serializers

## Thread Safety Improvements (PR #5)

### Fix 6: Synchronized Method for Thread Safety

**First Attempt - Simple But Slow:**
```java
private MovieService movieService;

private synchronized MovieService getService() {
    if (movieService == null) {
        movieService = App.getMovieService();
    }
    return movieService;
}
```

**Thread Safety:**
- ✅ Only one thread can execute synchronized method at a time
- ✅ Prevents race condition during initialization
- ✅ Thread-safe: guaranteed

**Performance:**
- ❌ ALL requests synchronize (even after initialization)
- ❌ Creates global lock
- ❌ Requests process sequentially
- ❌ Defeats multi-threading!

**Problem Illustration:**
```
Request 1: [synchronized] getService() → wait for lock → return
Request 2: [synchronized] getService() → wait for lock → return
Request 3: [synchronized] getService() → wait for lock → return
... all SEQUENTIAL, even though service is already initialized!
```

**Educational Value:**
- Synchronization guarantees thread safety
- But synchronization has performance cost
- Lock contention kills performance
- Need better solution for read-heavy scenarios

---

## Performance Optimization (PR #6)

### Fix 7: Double-Checked Locking Pattern

**Optimized Solution:**
```java
// volatile prevents instruction reordering
private volatile MovieService movieService;

private MovieService getService() {
    // First check (no lock) - FAST PATH
    if (movieService == null) {
        // Only synchronize if actually null
        synchronized (this) {
            // Second check (with lock) - prevent double init
            if (movieService == null) {
                movieService = App.getMovieService();
            }
        }
    }
    return movieService;
}
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Requires Java 5+**

This pattern was **broken in Java versions before Java 5** due to the old Java Memory Model. The `volatile` keyword behaves differently:
- **Java 1.4 and earlier:** volatile only guaranteed visibility, NOT ordering - this pattern could fail
- **Java 5+ (JSR-133):** volatile provides both visibility AND happens-before guarantees - pattern works correctly

Since we're using Java 17, this is safe. Don't use this pattern if supporting older JVMs.

**Why This Works:**

**1. volatile Keyword (Java 5+):**
- Ensures visibility across threads
- Prevents CPU instruction reordering through happens-before relationship
- Creates memory barrier: all writes before volatile write are visible after volatile read
- Without volatile: Thread B might see partially constructed object (broken reference before object initialization completes)

**2. First Check (No Lock):**
```java
if (movieService == null) {  // 99.9% of requests take this path
    // Only proceed if null
}
return movieService;  // Fast path - no synchronization!
```

**3. Synchronized Block:**
```java
synchronized (this) {
    // Only 1-2 threads ever reach here (during startup)
}
```

**4. Second Check:**
```java
if (movieService == null) {
    // Prevent double initialization
    // Thread A and B both passed first check
    // Thread A enters synchronized first, initializes
    // Thread B enters synchronized second, sees it's already done
}
```

**Performance Comparison:**

| Approach | First Request | Subsequent Requests | Concurrency |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| No synchronization | Fast | Fast | ❌ Unsafe (race condition) |
| synchronized method | Slow (lock) | Slow (lock) | ❌ Sequential |
| **Double-checked** | Slow (lock) | **Fast (no lock)** | ✅ Concurrent |

**Educational Value:**
- Double-checked locking is a classic pattern (but was broken before Java 5!)
- **Requires Java 5+ with volatile** - this is critical for correctness
- volatile is crucial (prevents seeing half-initialized objects through happens-before guarantees)
- Optimizes for the common case (already initialized)
- Only first few requests pay synchronization cost
- Demonstrates trade-off: complexity vs performance
- Java Memory Model: visibility, atomicity, ordering - JSR-133 fixed volatile semantics

---

### Fix 8: Direct Entity Updates (JPA Best Practice)

**Original Approach:**
```java
public Movie update(Movie movie) {
    em.getTransaction().begin();

    Movie existing = em.find(Movie.class, movie.getId());
    if (existing == null) return null;

    // merge() creates a copy and syncs it
    Movie updated = em.merge(movie);

    em.getTransaction().commit();
    return updated;
}
```

**Improved Approach:**
```java
public Movie update(Movie movie) {
    em.getTransaction().begin();

    // Find returns MANAGED entity
    Movie existing = em.find(Movie.class, movie.getId());
    if (existing == null) return null;

    // Update managed entity directly
    existing.setTitle(movie.getTitle());
    existing.setGenre(movie.getGenre());
    existing.setDurationMinutes(movie.getDurationMinutes());
    existing.setPrice(movie.getPrice());

    // JPA dirty checking auto-generates UPDATE
    em.getTransaction().commit();
    return existing;
}
```

**Why Direct Update Is Better:**

**1. No Object Copying:**
- merge() copies all fields from parameter to managed entity
- Direct update: just set fields (no copy overhead)

**2. Leverages JPA Dirty Checking:**
- **JPA tracks changes to MANAGED entities automatically** (key requirement!)
- Hibernate maintains a snapshot of the entity's state when it becomes managed
- On commit, Hibernate compares current state vs snapshot to detect changes
- Generates UPDATE SQL for only changed fields (efficient!)
- **IMPORTANT:** Dirty checking ONLY works for entities in managed state
  - Managed: Entity loaded by `em.find()`, `em.persist()`, or `em.merge()` within active persistence context
  - Detached: Entity exists but EntityManager is closed - changes NOT tracked
  - Transient: New object not yet persisted - not tracked
- No need to call merge() or persist() for managed entities

**3. Clearer Intent:**
- We're updating an existing entity, not merging states
- Code explicitly shows what fields are being updated

**4. More Efficient SQL:**
```sql
-- With merge (updates ALL fields):
UPDATE movies SET title=?, description=?, genre=?,
                  duration=?, price=? WHERE id=?

-- With dirty checking (only changed fields):
UPDATE movies SET price=? WHERE id=?
```

**JPA Entity Lifecycle:**
```
┌─────────────┐
│  Transient  │ → new Movie() - not tracked by JPA
└──────┬──────┘
       │ persist()
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  Managed    │ → JPA tracks changes (dirty checking)
└──────┬──────┘
       │ commit() / detach()
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  Detached   │ → was managed, now outside persistence context
└──────┬──────┘
       │ merge()
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  Managed    │ → copy of detached entity, now tracked again
└─────────────┘
```

**Educational Value:**
- Understanding JPA entity states is crucial - managed vs detached vs transient
- **Dirty checking only works for managed entities** - this is a key JPA concept
- Hibernate implementation: maintains entity snapshot, compares on flush/commit
- Work with managed entities when possible for automatic change tracking
- merge() has its place (for detached entities) but isn't needed for managed entities
- Efficiency: dirty checking generates SQL for only changed fields, not all fields
- Performance: Avoid unnecessary merge() calls - they create object copies

---

### Fix 9: Repository Input Validation

**Added Null Checks:**
```java
public Movie findById(Long id) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(id, "Movie ID cannot be null");
    // ... implementation
}

public Movie save(Movie movie) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(movie, "Movie cannot be null");
    // ... implementation
}

public Movie update(Movie movie) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(movie, "Movie cannot be null");
    Objects.requireNonNull(movie.getId(), "Movie ID cannot be null for update");
    // ... implementation
}

public boolean delete(Long id) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(id, "Movie ID cannot be null");
    // ... implementation
}
```

**Why Validate at Repository Layer Too:**

**Defense in Depth:**
```
REST Layer → basic checks (HTTP validation)
Service Layer → business validation ← primary validation
Repository Layer → technical validation ← catch programming errors
Database → constraints ← last resort
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fail-fast at entry point
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Catches programmer mistakes
- ✅ Repository can be used from multiple services
- ✅ Self-documenting (shows what's required)

**Educational Value:**
- Multiple validation layers serve different purposes
- Objects.requireNonNull() is idiomatic Java
- Descriptive error messages save debugging time
- Defensive programming: don't trust callers

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Concurrency Is Hard

**Key Insights:**
- Race conditions are non-deterministic (hardest to debug)
- "It works on my machine" often means untested concurrency
- Think about timing: what if another thread runs here?
- Atomicity: operations must be indivisible
- Always test concurrent scenarios

**Patterns to Remember:**
- Lazy initialization requires thread safety
- Double-checked locking (with volatile)
- Transactions provide atomicity
- Synchronized vs locks vs atomic variables

---

### 2. Resource Management Is Critical

**Key Insights:**
- Every opened resource must be closed
- Finally blocks are your friend
- Early returns can bypass cleanup
- Connection leaks crash production systems
- Try-with-resources for AutoCloseable

**Best Practices:**
```java
// Pattern 1: Traditional try-finally
Resource r = acquire();
try {
    use(r);
} finally {
    r.close();  // ALWAYS executes
}

// Pattern 2: Try-with-resources (preferred)
try (Resource r = acquire()) {
    use(r);
}  // Auto-closed
```

---

### 3. JPA Entity Lifecycle Matters

**Key States:**
- **Transient:** New object, not tracked
- **Managed:** Tracked by EntityManager, dirty checking active
- **Detached:** Was managed, now outside persistence context
- **Removed:** Marked for deletion

**Best Practices:**
- Work with managed entities when possible
- Understand when entities become detached
- Use merge() for detached entities
- Direct updates for managed entities
- Close EntityManager to detach

---

### 4. Validation Strategy

**Where to Validate:**
```
⚠️  Entity Setters → Avoid business logic here (conflicts with frameworks)
    - Bean Validation annotations (@NotNull, @Size, etc.) → ✅ Acceptable
    - Complex business logic in setters → ❌ Problematic
    - Simple null/type checks in setters → ✅ Acceptable (defensive)
✅ Service Layer → Business logic validation (primary location)
✅ Repository Layer → Technical validation (defensive programming)
✅ Database → Constraints (last line of defense)
```

**Why Avoid Complex Validation in Entity Setters:**
- JPA/Hibernate needs to call setters during entity loading from database
- JSON deserializers (Jackson) call setters when parsing requests
- Validation in setters can trigger during framework operations, not just business logic
- Complex business rules may not apply during entity hydration
- Makes entities tightly coupled to validation logic

**What IS Acceptable in Entity Setters:**
- Bean Validation annotations (@NotNull, @Min, @Max, @Email, etc.)
- Simple null checks for required fields
- Type constraints
- These don't interfere with framework operations

**What to Validate:**
- Null checks (Objects.requireNonNull)
- Required fields (not empty)
- Business rules (positive prices, valid ranges)
- Data format (email, phone, dates)
- Referential integrity (movie exists before booking)

---

### 5. Performance vs Correctness

**Trade-offs:**
- Simple synchronized: slow but obviously correct
- Double-checked locking: fast but complex
- No synchronization: fastest but incorrect

**Decision Framework:**
1. **First:** Make it work (correctness)
2. **Second:** Make it right (clean code)
3. **Third:** Make it fast (optimize)

**Remember:** Premature optimization is the root of all evil, but ignoring performance is also bad.

---

## Best Practices Established

### Code Organization

✅ **Layered Architecture:**
```
REST Resource (HTTP) → Service (Business Logic) → Repository (Data Access) → Database
```

✅ **Separation of Concerns:**
- REST: HTTP protocol, serialization
- Service: Validation, business rules
- Repository: Database operations
- Entity: Data structure

✅ **Dependency Injection:**
- Manual: Pass dependencies in constructor
- Future: Use CDI, Spring, or similar

---

### Error Handling

✅ **Fail-Fast:**
```java
Objects.requireNonNull(param, "Descriptive message");
if (invalid) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Why it's invalid: " + value);
```

✅ **Descriptive Messages:**
```java
// Bad: "Invalid input"
// Good: "Movie price must be positive (got: -10.0)"
```

✅ **Transaction Rollback:**
```java
try {
    em.getTransaction().begin();
    // ... operations
    em.getTransaction().commit();
} catch (Exception e) {
    if (em.getTransaction().isActive()) {
        em.getTransaction().rollback();
    }
    throw e;
}
```

## Conclusion

Through iterative code review and refinement, we transformed a basic database persistence implementation into production-ready code. Each fix addressed real-world issues:

- **Resource leaks** that crash systems
- **Race conditions** that cause non-deterministic failures
- **Performance bottlenecks** that limit scalability
- **Validation gaps** that allow bad data

The journey demonstrates that great code emerges through:
1. **Initial implementation** (make it work)
2. **Code review** (find issues)
3. **Thoughtful fixes** (make it right)
4. **Optimization** (make it fast)
5. **Documentation** (make it understandable)

**Most Important Lesson:** Code review is not criticism—it's collaboration. Every issue found is an opportunity to learn and improve.
